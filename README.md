# 🧠 My Custom AutoHotkey Scripts for Windows

A bunch of AutoHotkey scripts that make Windows behave more like GNOME — or at least more usable without reaching for the mouse every five seconds.

This repo includes hacks, remaps, workspace focus fixes, and tiny utilities to get my workflow feeling sane.

## ⚡ What’s In Here

### 🪟 Virtual Desktop (Workspace) Powerups

- **GNOME-style Workspace Switching**  
  Use  `Ctrl + Alt + Arrow` like in GNOME.

- **Auto-Focus Workspace**  
  When switching desktops, make sure the *focus follows* — so you can start typing immediately without clicking around.

- **Taskbar Hide/Show Behavior**  
  Taskbar stays hidden unless you press the Windows key. Prevents accidental popups.

### 🖐 Example Remaps

| Key Combo | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + Alt + <` | Move to previous workspace |
| `Ctrl + Alt + >` | Move to next workspace |
| `Win` | Reveal taskbar (only while held) |
| `Ctrl + Shift + [` | Enable touchpad |
| `Ctrl + Shift + ]` | Disable touchpad |

> Remaps inspired by GNOME habits.
